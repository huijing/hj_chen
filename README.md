It's an NPM card! ðŸ¤“

Forked from [Tierney Cyren](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang)  
You can make your own too, instructions by [Conlin Durbin](https://dev.to/wuz/setting-up-a-npx-username-card-1pip)

## Usage
Via npx:
```
npx huijing
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
